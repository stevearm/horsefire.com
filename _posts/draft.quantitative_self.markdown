I love charts. They explain things so well. I wish I could have a chart that tells me how long I spend walking every day, or how many calories I eat averaged out by hour and compared to my energy level. In Star Trek, they've got amazing medicine because they're in the future. The way I've always seen it is that the [tricorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder) gives them all the info they could want about a person's body, and better medicine follows naturally from that. I've always kind of believed that if I just had enough data, I could find the answers to all of my problems. If I could just compile a data set with the right stats, I could create visualizations of how everything works, and from there I would tweak things. The blocker is: where do I get that data set?

When you're administering a web server, you've got tons of log files and statistics you can derive information from. There's piles of data for you to sift through if you want to know

* which urls are being hit
* what browser
* what's the load on the server
* hard drive temperature
* your innermost fears
* memory usage

they're all there. Throw them all on a graph, compare, put an alarm for when they go over a certain level, whatever. My body and my life, however, don't have automatic stats. There's nothing running that writes a log message very time I sneeze. I can't get my current blood sugar level with a quick command the way I can see the current disk usage of my server. The digital world lends itself naturally to having too much data, but the physical world requires physical devices to measure data, and that costs effort or money or both. I was willing to put in some effort though, especially if it would save me money, so I got started.

Thus began **LifeTracker**.
