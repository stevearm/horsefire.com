I'm starting this blog to write. I'll be focusing technology, mostly on computers, mostly mostly on programming, and probably on whatever type of programming my current projects are in.

In general, I never have enough time (as I'm sure most people feel). There's always more I want to learn and apply, so I'm starting this so that when I hear about or read about something really cool that I'd like to check out, but I can't right now, I can atleast write a blog post about it to sort some of the info out, and then come back to the post later to actually investigate it.
