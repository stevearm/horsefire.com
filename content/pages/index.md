Welcome to the nexus of my various technology activities and ideas. From here, you can check out:

* The [blog][blog] convering topics from programming to security to IP law
* My personal [GitHub page][github-stevearm] containing a few of my projects, mostly Java heavy
* My professional [GitHub page][github-stephenarmstrong] used for work, which contains some public contributions
* An old GWT-PHP bridge library called [gwt-amp][gwt-amp] on Google Code

### About me

I'm Steve Armstrong, a software engineer and general internet nerd. I also like things like camping, sailing, and stuff that that, but those topics will stay on [stevearm.com][stevearm.com], so as not to [cross the streams][cross-the-streams].
