Welcome to the nexus of my various technology activities and ideas. From here, you can check out:

* The [blog][blog] covering topics from programming to security to IP law
* My [stevearm@GitHub][github-stevearm] personal account containing a few of my projects
* My [sarmstrong@GitHub][github-stephenarmstrong] work account, which contains some public contributions

### About me

I'm Steve Armstrong, a software engineer and general internet nerd. I also like things like camping, sailing, and stuff that that, but those topics will stay on [stevearm.com][stevearm.com], so as not to [cross the streams][cross-the-streams].
