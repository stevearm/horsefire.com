* It does fit in nicely with conversations recently about ad-blocking (which have flared up with the release of Apple's iOS 9).
* ATP said that there is no legal binding attached to web servers. They expose a port that will respond if you send the right request. You're not legally required to render whatever it returns to you, or legally required to view the ads that might be rendered, or whatever.
