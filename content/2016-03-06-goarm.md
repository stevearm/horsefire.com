Title: GOARM!

One of the first things I looked at when checking out [go][golang] for [IPFS][blog-post-ipfs] and [Camlistore][blog-post-camlistore] was how to cross-compile it to run on my Synology DS411j, which has an ARM v5 chip. Luckily it seems like I'm late enough to the game that [go cross-compiling is now easy][cross-compile].

I rewrote my [Mediawiki export utility][mediawiki-export] in go, and can compile it for my Synology with 3 simple arguments to the normal build command:

    env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go build cmd/mwexport


## Camlistore on ARMv5

Camlistore has its own build system (`go run make.go`) which handles cross-compiling, but doesn't provide a way to pass `GOARM`. I added this extra option and submitted a [pull request][camlistore-pull-request] to fix this. This let me to a permission problem on my laptop while running `go run make.go -os linux -arch arm`:

    mkdir /usr/lib/go/pkg/linux_arm: permission denied

There's probably a better way to solve this, but I got past it this way:

    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/go/pkg/linux_arm
    sudo chmod 777 /usr/lib/go/pkg/linux_arm
    go run make.go -os linux -arch arm
    sudo chown -R root:root /usr/lib/go/pkg/linux_arm
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib/go/pkg/linux_arm

These binaries are working fine on my Synology. With the various annoyances I've had running Java, or neutered python, on my Synology, I'm enjoying being able to straight-up cross-compile something to an ARM binary.
